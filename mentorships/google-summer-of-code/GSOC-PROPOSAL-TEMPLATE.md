## Project plan

> Describe any existing work and concepts on which your project is based. Share any preliminary findings or results which suggest that your approach is possible and likely to succeed. Propose a clear list of deliverables (depending on project size) that you will be working on. Optionally add architecture diagrams, wireframes, or other visual representations of your project that can help us better understand your project. Optionally note any uncertainties or aspects which would require further research or investigation.

## Project timeline

> Share a weekly schedule for your project. It is advisable to break down the entire timeline into phases and then into weeks where all the sub-tasks can be added. Include any dates or weeks you are unable to attend due to other commitments.  Optionally provide notes that can help the mentors understand your schedule and whether it falls within the GSoC timeline.
